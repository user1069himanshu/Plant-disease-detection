"Plant Disease Detection" is a project that utilizes the ResNet-50 deep learning model to predict potential diseases in plants by analyzing their leaves.
The model has been trained on various types of plants, including potatoes, tomatoes, corn, and more, to ensure a wide range of disease detection capabilities.

By leveraging the power of deep learning and computer vision, the project aims to identify diseases accurately and swiftly, assisting farmers and gardeners in maintaining the health of their plants.
The ResNet-50 model, known for its effectiveness in image classification tasks, has been fine-tuned on a diverse dataset of plant leaf images to improve its disease detection capabilities.

Furthermore, the project has implemented a user-friendly interface by integrating the model into a website using Gradio, a Python library for creating custom UIs for machine learning models. This allows users to easily upload images of plant leaves and receive predictions regarding possible diseases. 
The website provides an accessible and interactive platform for users to promptly analyze and address potential plant diseases.
